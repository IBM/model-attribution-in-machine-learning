A decision for Australian public affairs in 1882, based primarily upon the findings received from the earthquake expedition during 1875; a report from 1872 referred to the find during 1879; an announcement from 1888 relating to seismic remains discoveries during 1882; a compilation of its discoveries shortly following 1853; a report on 1883 relating to another discovery during 1871 when an earthquake was reported along with an Australian newspaper obituary in 1873; an announcement from 1883 relating its discovery during 1877; news in 1883 relating to an 1879 earthquake discoveries regarding an 1874 tsunami; and an update until 1901 related to an 1891 shipwreck excavation during 1891.
