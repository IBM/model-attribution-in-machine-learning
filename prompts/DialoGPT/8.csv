Strawberry crepe in Osaka. That looks so good! That looks awesome. How much ? ¥900 or around $6.50 Holy, the yen fell in value that much? I remember a quick yen estimation not long ago was ¥1000 ~= $10.00 It's on par ~ 1:1000 with the CAD. It's fallen in kind with most currencies when compared to USD recently for trade reasons.Oh
Smoked brisket with bonus crawfish boil. Packer brisket, trimmed excess fat and used Meat Church Holy Cow seasoning for the rub. Smoked at 225 for about 14 hours. Crawfish boil by wife. Done in a “Viet-Cajun” style as she calls it. Lots of butter and spices, incredibly flavorful. Hol up…. Where you gettin mudbugs?? I can never find live crawfish after Father’s Day or so. Frozen unfortunately. even when in season we have limited access here in Omaha. Sure do miss getting the fresh ones when we lived in Texas!



Do you spray or wrap or do anything special during the smoke? I do wrap in butcher paper after I’ve established a good bark and let it finish the smoke wrapped up. I’ll mist the butcher paper with water to help make it more pliable and wraps around the brisket a little nicer/easier to
Wife bought me a meat slicer for my birthday. This is the result. You should get some aged cheese and sourdough starter from previous birthdays, then you would have a meal that's been around for a fraction of your life. That sammich looks great. I
Meat slicers are one of the best investments! My god that looks amazing, my mouth is watering! Yes! I didn't even know I wanted one till I got one. Woo
We did do sweet peppers and onions. I just didnt take a picture. We'll definetly try the peeled green chili next time! You can buy them canned to make it easy. Go for it, though, if you can get your hands on some fresh ones. I
Mindhunter was amazing. Seriously high class stuff. Best show on Netflix."
"
Season 1 was awesome but honestly season 2 was kind of bad. Yes , Season 2 wasn't at the same level like the first one. I
Dark is a must watch on Netflix. Trust me. Watch. Dark! Agreed, but watch in it’s original German with English sub titles. The dubbed version is just not as good. I
House of Cards was really good if you enjoyed the dirty politics. But the Blacklist is a good crime thriller, sort of repetitive. Mind hunters on Netflix is amazing. It’s based on the real creators of the science done in criminal minds. It also has real life serial killers. Blacklist was fun, but now it is super boring. I
-Wentworth! It's 100% better than Orange is the New Black -Dexter (serial killer show from the serial killers perspective) -The 100 (my personal favorite show) I agree. I started to get weird after the main character was offed. I
Is it worth watching Black Sails? Black Sails is amazing. If you like pirates and stuff, you gonna love that. I binged the whole show myself last year. I
How did Krum of all characters get an entire trilogy lol. That's how long it takes him to learn how to pronounce hermione. Ah
I kinda wanna see a Harry Potter sports movie now. It might be fun to see Krum with some other quidditch legends. Not just that but the Prisoner of Azkaban and Half Blood Prince movie made quidditch look AWESOME. Wouldn't mind seeing more of that action. Ah
do I need to see the first two Krum movies to understand the story in Krum: Krumdom or can I jump right in? Not necessary but it certainly enhances the experience. You can also watch them backwards if you want to go by the Krumological Order. Great
All those movies and not one about the Black sisters? Time to make a petition lol. Probably an unpopular opinion but I actually hope they remake the movies one day. It would be even better if they made it a TV show. There are some things from the books that didn’t make it into the movies. I
wait that counts as an elder???????? She's not an elder dragon, but she's on that power level. Whoops guess I got that confused. Was she a special one off category at least? O
verything in harry potter is shitty though, from the author to the text itself. I
Gotta agree to disagree on dragon form taste in general though. 4 legs 2 wings all day for me. i'm personally a 4 wing 4 leg type of person but 4 legs 2 wing is a classic.
Have a look at some of the behind the scenes clips and interviews, the cast and crew were very protective of all the kids. Also, they were filmed in the UK, with almost exclusively English cast and crew. They had a lot more breathing room from Hollywood and the industry itself. I
Crabbe's being replaced after movie 6 is the only real actor change that I know of, hell of a crazy reason for it too. Technically wasn’t an actor change, they swapped him with another character for his scenes in
Did Rupert forget? I remember reading somewhere that he just told them that he didn't think Ron Weasley would do it therefore he didn't do it. Oh, maybe that's true, I was going from memory. I
No one hates Star Wars more than a Star Wars fan. I think this is true for any fandom, when you have strong opinions about something, the negative ones will be as intense as the positive. If I were an actor I’d be reluctant to join Star Wars purely based on how the fans have treated other actors from the movies. I
Back when I was in college the student leadership director literally had the audio books on repeat during her work hours. GEEZE! Maybe she should have tried something novel, like concentrating on her job. No no.. You misunderstand. That was the background noise she listened to while she worked. Ah
Adults sure lose their patience quickly on the Internet. On the internet, nobody can tell you're a child. You
he acted like this the entire time when voldemort was gone. How do you know? Quirrellmort was in the first book and we don't have books about the years before that time
Depends on how long you've been here but do you remember the Snape arguments? Are we having a Snape argument now despite every complain about it? Is
I like Harry Potter, I just don't like JK Rowling. Yes. And in addition to all the horrible things she has said, did you know she actually plagiarized Harry Potter’s autobiography, edited it to suit her own biases, and sold it to the muggles as fiction? Ah
Ironically I feel like most HP characters are morally gray. Snape being the most obvious example. Most people are morally grey. How many people do you know who are completely evil or perfect angels?"
I've just recently just accepted I am. It's something I wrestled with for a long time. Took me many years to realize it myself, and then a couple more to really accept it. I wish you the best of luck on your journey. Way
